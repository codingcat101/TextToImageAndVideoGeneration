# Text-to-Image and Video Generation Project

Welcome to the **Text-to-Image and Video Generation Project**! This project is designed to harness the power of modern AI to bring your textual descriptions to life as realistic images and dynamic videos.

## Features

### Text-to-Image Generation
- Converts textual descriptions into high-quality, realistic images.
- Utilizes cutting-edge deep learning models for image synthesis.
- Supports fine-grained control over the output's appearance and style.

### Video Generation
- Extends text-to-image capabilities to produce dynamic video content.
- Creates smooth transitions and sequences based on text prompts.
- Ideal for generating animations, storytelling, or creative content.

## How It Works
1. **Input**: Provide a textual description of the image or video you want to generate.
2. **Processing**: The system leverages advanced diffusion models to generate the requested output.
3. **Output**: The generated image or video is delivered in a format ready for use or further customization.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required libraries: PyTorch, Transformers, and Diffusers.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/text-to-image-video-generation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd text-to-image-video-generation
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
#### Text-to-Image
```bash
python generate_image.py --text "A serene mountain landscape with a clear blue sky"
```

#### Video Generation
```bash
python generate_video.py --text "A cityscape transitioning from day to night"
```

## Customization
- Modify generation parameters (e.g., resolution, style) using configuration files or command-line arguments.
- Use your own datasets or fine-tune models for specialized applications.

## Examples
- **Text Input**: "A futuristic city at sunset."
  - **Generated Image**: A vibrant depiction of a sci-fi city bathed in warm hues.
- **Text Input**: "A bird flying over a forest in the morning mist."
  - **Generated Video**: A seamless clip showing a bird's flight through a misty forest.
